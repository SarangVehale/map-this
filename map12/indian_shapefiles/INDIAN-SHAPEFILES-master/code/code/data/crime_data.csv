He claimed to be a stock broker and along with 2 other partners Jessica (8972083328) representing LSV management and Swati Rajput (8274836920) one of the group admins. They used an app which is called LSV Asset Management  through which members in the whatsapp group were trading stocks. I had deposited close 10 lakhs over multiple transactions over the last month starting from 12th August. They maintained multiple bank accounts into which I deposited (most of them with UCO bank). Through the app  I could see that I had generated a lot of profit close to 30 lakhs. However  when I tried to withdraw money from LSV Asset Management App  they asked me to deposit an additional 3 51 150  which I deposited  after which there was no other response from them. I tried calling each member mentioned above to get my money back  but none of their numbers were reachable. I hope through the help of the cyber crime police I am able to recover the amount.

After many multiple frustrated attempts to reach them  I ended up calling a number from Google that turned out to be a scam. They promised room availability  took my money 1800/- via PhonePe  and  later tried to scam me further by asking me to enter a receipt number in the amount column  which was actually an amount they wanted me to send in guise of believing in God. Thankfully  I realized it was a scam before losing more  but they blocked me after I refused. Be cautious and double-check before making any payments online. Bad to know that such a reputed guest house didnt realise whats happening in online and requesting Google to please verify someone when they are entering details as the owner of any business.

Once I had invested almost 78 lakhs in total  I felt like I needed to stop trading. Once I conveyed my intentions  he immediately told me that there are huge losses and in order to recover the principal invested amount  I was asked to send an equal amount to even get back a portion of my investment.

The caller introduced himself as a representative of DHL and claimed that a parcel in my name  allegedly sent from Mumbai to Taiwan  had been seized by the customs department. He further threatened that legal action would be taken against me due to the contents of the parcel. The caller then proceeded to confirm my Aadhaar number  which he already had  and attempted to obtain more personal information from me. This situation alarmed me  as I have never sent any parcel to Taiwan  nor do I have any business that would involve such a transaction. It became clear to me that this was a fraudulent attempt to deceive me and possibly steal my identity or money. Given the seriousness of this incident  I am deeply concerned about the potential risks involved  not only to myself but also to others who might fall victim to similar scams. Therefore  I kindly request that you investigate this matter thoroughly and take strict legal action against the individuals involved in this scam. It is crucial to prevent such fraudsters from causing harm to others in the future. Please treat this complaint with urgency  as such incidents pose a significant threat to public safety and security.

2386,20209240034755,Maddu Sirisha,9160938124,ANDHRA PRADESH,I got a phone call saying my number will be blocked because of an FIR registered on my name in Mumbai police station and asked me to report personally in 2 hours or else theres an online process from Mumbai police and I got a whatsapp call saying they are Mumbai police and they were in Uniform. I was on video call for the whole time approximately one hour. I was threatened that my aadhar card is being used for illegal purposes like money laundering and human trafficking and also national threat causing transactions aswell. I was even asked to share my photo and aadhar card for filing a complaint of missusing my details. So initially I believed them and sent the soft copy of my Aadhar card and my photo out of suspicion I deleted them in 15 minutes in whatsApp. I was threatened that there is an arrest warrant issued on my name and its non bailable and I was not allowed to disconnect the call or take a break. I revealed the details of my husband job and education along with my children age and my whereabouts believing that they are from the Police Department. I am abused verbally and asked for my account details by that person which I denied and refused to share then they started scolding me. The whole conversation is done from the whatsApp number 6003738697 and audio call from the number 9921864229.Please take action against them so that my details will not be miss used in any other ways.

This not only resulted in significant financial losses as they drained our ad spend but also posed a reputational risk  as the fake ads could be associated with our brand.The hacker likely bypassed our security measures  possibly through phishing or exploiting weak passwords  and took control of the account. Once inside  they had full access to our ad campaigns  billing information  and other sensitive data. They swiftly created and launched their own ads  diverting our funds towards their malicious activities.In response  weve taken immediate action to secure our account. This included contacting Facebook to report the breach  freezing all ad activity  and reviewing our account settings.

The Credit Card was with me all the time and these transactions were unauthorised. The amounts of the transactions were Rs.10 000  Rs.10 000 and Rs.5 000.  On receipt of SMS alert from the bank I got the Credit Card blocked but one transaction for Rs.10 000 with authorisation code 079433 was successful for which dispute has been raised. For processing my request the Bank requires copy of the FIR. Before that between 1205 pm and 1215 pm a Delivery Boy came from Ekart with Flipkart ordered COD item. Since I had never placed any such order  I asked him to take it back. He  however  insisted on sharing the OTP received from Ekart just to confirm that he actually met me. I shared the OTP with him at 1212 pm in good faith and these fraudulent transactions  took place thereafter. Unauthorised attempts were also made to misuse my Amazon account and AmazonPay ICICI Bank Credit Card.I hold Credit/Debit Cards from other Banks too and accounts as well.

I found this app through well-known YouTubers promoting it as a legitimate investment platform. The app promised a 1 percent return on investments after just one day.I started using Hibox in May  and although I received initial withdrawal payments  I never got the promised extra 1 percent. This raised concerns  but I trusted the app due to my earlier successful withdrawals.On July 31st  2024  the app introduced a mystery boxes feature  urging users to invest more money for potentially higher returns. Unfortunately  I added more funds based on these promises  but when I tried to withdraw my money  the process never completed.Despite many attempts to contact customer support  I have not received any response. My withdrawal status remains pending  and my funds have not been credited back to my account. The app failure to deliver on its commitments and its lack of communication have led me to believe that I have been scammed out of my money.",OUTER NORTH,BHALSWA DIARY PS,Online Financial Fraud,Debit/Credit Card Fraud/Sim Swap Fraud,,,Registered,01/08/2024,02/09/2024,75000.00,0.00,

When I contacted him  he added me to another whatsapp group (attached the complete chat details) where he kept giving stock trading plans for a period of 6 weeks. He said he is launching a book on stock trading and he wants us to promote his book if we get profits by his guidance (so  no suspicion here). After some time  he said indian market is not a gaurantee for profits always so we will trade in US market where pre-market trading will return huge profits(minimum 4 every day). He asked us to create an account in some website called Driahaus (https//m.driehaus-c.com/) (realized only later that this is a fake website). He showed profits everyday and pushed people to increase funding if we want to continue trading with him in future. He also talks regularly over telegram with individuals and poses as if he is assessing their performance and would let them join his group after this 6 weeks period.

They had a couple of conditions  if I do not complete my work within 12 days or if the accuracy of my work is below 85 percent  I need to pay 3999. I am in need of money  I agreed and uploaded my details in order to  register. Only after registering I got to know about the agreement. It was mentioned  I should not leave any space  letter or even a single comma or full stop. If I leave even a single extra space  the whole form is considered as incorrect form. Also while I was typing I noticed many of the spellings were not correct and many of the answers were not clear and it was a bit confusing  in many of the forms words were not visible completely. After completing the task  they called me and said the accuracy was below 85 percent and asked me to pay 3999 immediately. I checked the report  I also noticed that many of the forms which were right were also marked as incorrect.  They texted me and started threatening me  they asked me do the payment immediately within 10 minutes. Two members tried contacting me and started threatening me. (7741887386 / 7249324144) . I also received a mail. I did not reply them back. Many of them are being scammed by these people. I am complaining hoping that some actions would be taken. I humbly request you to do the needful.

Despite diligent initial verifications  I was deceived by sophisticated fraudulent practices.In July 2024  after reading an article on LinkedIn  I contacted a broker through WhatsApp  who facilitated my registration and introduced me to what I believed were legitimate trading sessions. The communications included emails from smc.caresmcindiaonlinee.com  a slight misspelling of the actual SMC email address  which I overlooked.I made an initial investment and participated in daily trading sessions. Subsequent interactions included requests for additional payments under various pretexts  such as third-party account transactions validated by a falsified SEBI certificate and unexpected tax demands  leading to significant financial losses.Upon deeper investigation and confirmation from the official SMC team  I realized the extent of the scam. I have compiled all relevant documentation  including screenshots  bank transactions  and WhatsApp messages  which I am prepared to provide for your review.I understand there was an oversight on my part  but after uncovering the scam  I am seeking your guidance and support to resolve this issue and prevent further exploitation.

However  on the third transaction  the withdrawal process was abruptly halted.This led me to conduct further investigations into their website  communications  and the identities of other individuals involved. Upon closer scrutiny  it became evident that the website they operate underblackrock88.comis fraudulent  with links that do not function. Moreover  the individuals identities  including phone numbers verified via Truecaller  all point to fake profiles and scripted interactions.It appears that this group is engaged in a sophisticated scam designed to extract funds from unsuspecting individuals. They pressure their targets to deposit additional money into various accounts based in India  under the false promise of an 800 return on investment. However  they refuse to release any funds unless further deposits are made.I am deeply concerned about the potential for others to fall victim to this scheme and urge immediate action to address and publicize this fraudulent activity.

They connected me to a fake Mumbai police station and said I was a suspect in a money laundering case involving someone named Suresh Anurag.They emotionally blackmailed me  claiming my carelessness led to someones suicide  and pressured me not to tell anyone. A supposed CBI officer then video-called me for hours  insisting I transfer all my money for verification. Fortunately  I didnt have my cheque book or passbook  which saved me.I realized it was a scam when I thought about it. Real officers wouldnt spend hours on a video call  and any legitimate case would go through local police.  These all things made me realise that this is an actual fraud. I was in trauma for so many weeks. Later I thought to register it on this website only but it was not working. I tried multiple times but no outcome then I tried calling 1930 but same outcome.

He discussed my interview performance and informed me that I was selected for the Data Analyst role on the condition that I complete a certification course in Matplotlib. I was assured that the cost of the certification  INR 18 500  would be reimbursed upon submission of the certificate. I promptly enrolled in the course  submitted the required documents  and received an Offer Letter of Intent. contact numbers are now unreachable  and emails sent to the addresses provided have bounced back as invalid. Despite multiple attempts to contact them  the only response I received was a brief message from HR Sandeep via WhatsApp. Now the contact i have from whatsApp is also broken.Mail id through which i was connected --  hrpepsico-ind.com and courseslearnmatplotlib.com. Also the course site is also a fraid site they are using the name of big company to sell their course as first conducted interview then give offer letter.

And they were paying me good amount . So I thought that I should tell this to my family and accept the proposal . I met this model named Raj Chaturvedi and one of his friend on Instagram . And we spoke about shoot and all . The moment I felt that he is going off track . I thought what he really wants from me . So he started saying things related to sex . I accept that I shouldn’t have agreed or answered to his nonsense things . I wanted to know whether this guy is fake . If I will go to Mumbai I shouldn’t be caught in any trap. That is my mistake . The moment I got to know  I immediately stopped talking to this guy . And this has hurted his ego . I told one of my good friend about this . Even I told my husband about it .I never spoke twith him over a call. I accept that spoke to Now he is threatening me on my official email ID that either I say sorry that I was rude to him . I thought by saying sorry he will stop mailing so I sent him a apology.

Despite management being informed and an investigation being conducted  the issue has not been adequately addressed. In fact  when a student named Shah was found with a Google Drive link containing folders with explicit mentions of girls names and their respective morphed photos on his phone  he was expelled from the college. However  he still poses a threat to the society and the affected girls were not even informed about the incident by the management. The girls have come to know about it through hearsay  and many confirm that Shah was not the only one involved  but rather part of a group of boys who are still hidden from the limelight.I request that suitable action be taken to prevent the society from these threats. It is essential that the college takes concrete steps to address this issue  rather than sweeping it under the rug to protect its reputation. The affected girls deserve justice  and the college must take responsibility for ensuring their safety and security on campus.",CHENNAI - CCB,,Sexually Obscene material,,,,Registered,02/09/2024,02/09/2024,0.00,0.00,

This is about a creator on Tango Live with the id name awesome-person 980470 and display name as Village Girls (screen shot attached above). Tango Live is an application where many creators do Live stream and adult private streams to earn coins through viewers. It only include legal livestreams with all models/ creators 18 plus only and the application have strict moderation policy. This account currently also do regular adult based live streams like everyone else and do not do anything illegal or involve any minor lately. Everyone in their live stream is 18 plus currently. This can be verified through their livestreams as well. However this tip is regarding a series of live stream that they did about 4-5 months ago for about a week (I am unsure of the exact time) where in my personal opinion a potential minor who looked between 16 to 19 also appeared in their stream and Tango groups made by them. I am still unsure if that girl was a minor or not and only appeared in their streams for 1 week about 4-5 months ago but as a responsible citizen I want to report this incident so that if that girl was a minor she can be rescued if needed. The creators appear to be from UP state. I am unsure if other viewers or app moderators would have noticed it as it was not clear if she was a minor or not.

And they were paying me good amount . So I thought that I should tell this to my family and accept the proposal . I met this model named Raj Chaturvedi and one of his friend on Instagram . And we spoke about shoot and all . The moment I felt that he is going off track . I thought what he really wants from me . So he started saying things related to sex . I accept that I shouldnt have agreed or answered to his nonsense things . I wanted to know whether this guy is fake . If I will go to Mumbai I shouldnt be caught in any trap. That is my mistake . The moment I got to know  I immediately stopped talking to this guy . And this has hurted his ego . I told one of my good friend about this .
